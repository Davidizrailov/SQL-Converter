The provided Structured Query Report (SQR) code is a script used in PeopleSoft to perform various date calculations and manipulations. Here is a step-by-step explanation of what the code is doing:

1. **Header Section**:
   - The header provides metadata about the report, including its name (`DATECALC.SQR`), description (PeopleSoft DATE Calculation & Manipulation), and the component it runs under (`PRCSMULTI`).

2. **Include Statements**:
   - The script includes several external SQC files that contain predefined procedures and functions for setting the environment (`setenv.sqc`), getting the current date and time (`curdttim.sqc`), date and time formatting (`datetime.sqc`), number formatting (`number.sqc`), updating the process API (`stdapi.sqc`), date manipulation functions (`datemath.sqc`), and date validations (`validdt.sqc`).

3. **Begin-Program Block**:
   - The main program starts with the `Begin-Program` block.
   - It calls three procedures in sequence: `Init_Report`, `Main_Report`, and `Stdapi-Term`.

4. **Init_Report Procedure**:
   - This procedure initializes the report by calling three other procedures: `Stdapi-Init`, `Init-DateTime`, and `Init-Number`.
   - It also calls `Get-Current-DateTime` to retrieve the current date and time.

5. **Main_Report Procedure**:
   - This is the core procedure where various date calculations and manipulations are performed.
   - It sets a reference date (`$BackDay`) and another date for year calculations (`$BackDayYear`).
   - It converts the current date (`$AsOfToday`) to a specific format using `Convert-To-DTU-Date`.

6. **Date Difference Calculations**:
   - The script calculates the difference in days, months, years, and weeks between `$BackDay` and the current date (`$Today`).
   - It uses procedures `dtu-diff-days`, `Dtu-Diff-Months`, `Dtu-Diff-years`, and `dtu-diff-weeks` to perform these calculations and stores the results in variables (`$GetDateDiff`, `$GetMonthDiff`, `$GetYearDiff`, `$GetWeekDiff`).

7. **Date Parsing and String Building**:
   - It parses the current date into year, month, and day components using `dtu-parse-date`.
   - It then converts these components to strings and builds two formatted date strings (`$BuildingStringDateV1` and `$BuildingStringDateV2`).

8. **Year Begin and End Calculations**:
   - It calculates the beginning and end dates of the year 2013 using `DTU-Format-Date` and converts them to a specific format using `Convert-From-DTU-Date`.

9. **Date Addition**:
   - It adds 7 weeks to the current date using `DTU-Add-Weeks` and stores the result in `$WorkDate`.
   - It also gets the start and end dates of the current month using `Get_Month_Start_Date` and `Get_Month_End_Date`.

10. **Day of the Week Calculation**:
    - It determines the day of the week for the current date using `DTU-DayOfWeek#`.

11. **Date Addition and Subtraction**:
    - It subtracts 3 months from the current date using `DTU-Add-Months`.
    - It subtracts 2 years from the current date using `DTU-Add-Years`.

12. **Age Calculation**:
    - It calculates the age in years from a given date of birth (`$Dob`) to the current date using `Dtu-Diff-Years`.

13. **Get_Month_End_Date Procedure**:
    - This procedure calculates the end date of a given month, taking into account leap years.

14. **Get_Month_Start_Date Procedure**:
    - This procedure calculates the start date of a given month.

15. **dtu-diff-weeks Procedure**:
    - This custom procedure calculates the difference in weeks between two dates.

16. **Standard Include Files**:
    - The script includes several standard SQC files for various functionalities like getting the current date and time, date and time formatting, number formatting, updating the process API, date manipulation functions, and date validations.

Overall, the script is designed to perform a variety of date-related calculations and manipulations, including differences between dates, parsing dates, formatting dates, and adding or subtracting time intervals.
